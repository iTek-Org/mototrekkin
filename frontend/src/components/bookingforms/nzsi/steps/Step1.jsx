          Welcome to the New Zealand South Island 2025 (NZSI2025) registration page!
        </p>
        
        <p>
          You're about to secure your spot on one of the most unique and incredible off-road motorcycle adventures possible. There is nothing in Australia that compares to riding the incredible trails NZSI. And let's be honest, riding something different, other than the east coast of Australia, will be a refreshing change, right?
        </p>
        
        <p>
          In true Moto Trekkin form we've spent months planning, scoping and verifying the most achievable, yet most exciting and scenic routes available on the South Island of New Zealand. In the process we have circumnavigated the entire south island multiple times, also criss crossing the country in multiple directions to deliver a truly awesome motorcycle experience for you.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The result is six breathtaking days of the best sealed and unsealed adventure riding routes available anywhere in the world. We've also planned adequate time each day for you to explore and enjoy the local offerings of NZSI.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          NZSI is open to the first fifty successful registrations, which is limited only by the number of hire motorcycles available. During registration you will choose your preferred motorcycle which will be included in the price presented to you at the completion of your online registration.
